A CLI that writes your git commit messages for you with AI. This project was inspired by [AI Commits](https://github.com/Nutlope/aicommits) and has been ported to Rust.

## Installation

### Using Cargo

1. Install Rust and Cargo. Then run:

```bash
cargo install aicommits-rs
```

2. Retrieve your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

   > Note: If you haven't already, you'll have to create an account and set up billing.
3. Set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

### Homebrew (Mac Only)

Run the following command to install the latest version of the CLI tool:

```bash
brew install EtaCassiopeia/tap/aicommits-rs
```

### Linux
run the following command to install the latest version of the CLI tool:

```bash
curl -L //TBD
```

## Usage

```bash
aicommits-rs
```

## How it works

This CLI tool uses `git diff` to obtain all of the most recent code changes, and then sends them to OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate a commit message that is returned. If the returned commit message is not satisfactory, you can run the command again to generate a new commit message, otherwise you can use the returned commit message to commit your changes.

> Note: An error may occur when the number of changes being made to a file is too large for the OpenAI API to process. To avoid this error, try reducing the number of staged changes or writing your own commit message. 

> Note: This tool is still in development, and is not guaranteed to work as expected.
